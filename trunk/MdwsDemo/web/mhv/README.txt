This directory shows one very low tech way to mock up a user interface for MHV for the purpose of 
displaying some new functionality.

The ideal situation is, of course, to have access to the source code and a way to integrate your interface
in a more integrated fashion. However, for the sake of simplicity, the method shown here works for the purpose
of showing a new interface embedded in the concept phase.

To obtain this interface, I simply visited the MHV web site with a well known test user account,
navigate to the page I wanted to mock, chose to save the page via my browser's menu and then copied
the files to my MDWS-Demo project and placed the contents inside an ASPX page where I could enhance
the interface as needed. 

This is in no way guaranteed to serve as a true proof of concept MHV integration. The GUI here is
intended to to demonstrate the underlying technology only.
